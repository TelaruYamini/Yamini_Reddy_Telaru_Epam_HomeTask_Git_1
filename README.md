Yamini_Reddy_Telaru_Epam_HomeTask_Git_1

This is the first Home Task given to us to upload our project files into Git Hub using Git commands. In reference to this, I have added my Project called "Predictive Analysis in Agriculture to improve Crop Productivity using Machine Learning" into this repository from my local repository through Command line Git commands. In this repository 4 files are uploaded which consists of both the dataset and Python files.
